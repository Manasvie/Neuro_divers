# Neuro_divers
Neurodivers addresses neurodiversity and provide educational information and resources about neurodivergence so that people can become more aware about neuro-divergent brains and help create a better world for everyone regardless of differences.  By raising awareness about neurodiversity, we promote inclusivity and acceptance of individuals with diverse neurological profiles. This shift in perspective helps reduce stigma and discrimination, creating a more inclusive environment. Awareness about neurodiversity is essential for fostering inclusivity, challenging stereotypes, promoting understanding, providing support, capitalizing on diverse talents, and empowering neurodiverse individuals. It contributes to creating a more accepting and accommodating society where everyone can thrive.
